# Vehicle CO2 Emissions Research

The goal of this project is to analyze the "Vehicle Attributes and Emissions Dataset" to gain insights into vehicle characteristics, fuel efficiency, and CO2 emissions for vehicles manufactured in the year 2000. By examining factors such as engine size, cylinder count, transmission type, and fuel type.

This project was created as part of the Data Analytics Essentials course administered by CISCO.

## ðŸš€ Starting/ComeÃ§ando
After selecting the dataset and conducting a brief analysis of the information contained within, I was able to raise some questions, such as:
* Is there any trend regarding fuel efficiency based on vehicle type (compact, medium, etc.) or fuel type used?
* What is the average difference in CO2 emissions between vehicles of different classes (compact, medium, etc.)?
* How are engine size and number of cylinders related to CO2 emissions?
* Do vehicles with automatic transmission have different CO2 emissions than vehicles with manual transmission?
* Has there been any change in fuel efficiency or CO2 emissions over time for vehicles manufactured in 2000?
* Is there a difference in fuel efficiency and emissions trends among vehicle manufacturers?
* Do vehicles powered by different types of fuel (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, etc.) have different patterns of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?
